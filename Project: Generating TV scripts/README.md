# Recurrent Neural Network

Recurrent Neural Networks were created in the 1980?s but have just been recently gaining popularity from advances to the networks designs and increased computational power from graphic processing units. They?re especially useful with sequential data because each neuron or unit can use its internal memory to maintain information about the previous input. This is great because in cases of language, ?I had washed my house? is much more different than ?I had my house washed?. This allows the network to gain a deeper understanding of the statement.

### Project Description

In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern

This is probably the best RNNs descritption on the internet except perhaps UDACITY
