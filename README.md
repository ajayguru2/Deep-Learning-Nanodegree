This repository holds all of my work which I did in my Udacity deep learning nanodegree course. It contains the following

  - All of the Projects in their notebook form with an extension of .ipynb and .html
  - Some of the experiments I did along the way
  - Some motivation and external resources


### Projects

Projects are an integral part of a nanodegree. That's what makes learning so interactive and fun. I have included the following projects in this repo
| Project Name | Availability |
| ------ | ------ |
| Handmade Neural Net | Available |
| Dog Breed Classifier | Available |
| Generating TV scripts | Available |
| Generating Faces | Available |
| Teaching a quadcopter to fly | Available |
