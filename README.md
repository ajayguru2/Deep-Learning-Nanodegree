# Deep Learning Nanodegree

[![u](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Udacity_logo.png)](https://in.udacity.com/course/deep-leâ€¦)

This repository holds all of my work which I did in my Udacity deep learning nanodegree course. It contains the following

  - All of the Projects in their notebook form with an extension of .ipynb and .html
  - Some of the experiments I did along the way
  - Some motivation and external resources


### Projects

Projects are an integral part of a nanodegree. That's what makes learning so interactive and fun. I have included the following projects in this repo.

| Project Name | Availability |
| ------ | ------ |
| Handmade Neural Net | [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llGurudevll/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/master/success.png">](https://github.com/llGurudevll/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project:%20Handmade%20Neural%20Net) |
